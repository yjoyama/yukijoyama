<br>
I am a physician-biostatistician, based in New York, committed to preventing life-threatening diseases through evidence-based research and innovative technology.  
I transform clinical and population-health questions into actionable insights by designing studies, cleaning and analyzing data, and translating results for clinicians, policymakers, and patients.   
I also have several years of experience in patient-facing role from my residency program in Japan.   
My early-career mission is to harness biostatistical methods for biological, clinical, and epidemiological research that can improve millions of lives worldwide. 

You can find my academic and professional experience [here](about.html).
